===================================================

Pheromone dispersion study near Pullman, WA (Summer 2012)
---------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains an operating program for recording data from four
Applied Technology Inc (ATI) sonic anemometers (SATI-* series) using a 
[CR1000](http://www.campbellsci.com/cr1000) datalogger from Campbell Scientific
Inc (CSI). The program was prepared for a field study conducted by 
[Dr. Steve Edburg](http://www.ce.wsu.edu/Faculty_Staff/Profiles/edburg.htm)
at the WSU Tukey Orchard during the summer of 2012.
